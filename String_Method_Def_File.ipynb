      "\n",

      "\n",
      "count ==>  The count() method returns the number of times a specified value appears in the string. \n",
      "\n",
      "encode ==>  The encode() method encodes the string, using the specified encoding. If no encoding is specified, UTF-8 will be used. \n",

      "\n",
      "find ==>  The find() method is almost the same as the index() method, the only difference is that the index() method raises an exception if the value is not found. \n",
      "\n",
      "format ==>  The format() method formats the specified value(s) and insert them inside the string's placeholder. The placeholder is defined using curly brackets: {}.  \n",
      "\n",

Exponents, like Â² and Â¾ are also considered to be numeric values. \"-1\" and \"1.5\" are NOT considered numeric values, because all the characters in the string must be numeric, and the - and the . are not. \n",
      "\n",
      "isprintable ==>  The isprintable() method returns True if all the characters are printable, otherwise False. Example of none printable character can be carriage return and line feed. \n",

      "lower ==>  The lower() method returns a string where all characters are lower case. \n",
      "\n",
      "lstrip ==>  The lstrip() method removes any leading characters (space is the default leading character to remove). \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "partition ==>  The partition() method searches for a specified string, and splits the string into a tuple containing three elements. The first element contains the part before the specified string. The second element contains the specified string. The third element contains the part after the string. \n",
      "\n",
      "replace ==>  The replace() method replaces a specified phrase with another specified phrase. \n",
      "\n",
      "rfind ==>  The rfind() method finds the last occurrence of the specified value. The rfind() method returns -1 if the value is not found. The rfind() method is almost the same as the rindex(). \n",
      "\n",
      "rindex ==>  The rindex() method finds the last occurrence of the specified value. The rindex() method raises an exception if the value is not found. The rindex() method is almost the same as the rfind() \n",

The first element contains the part before the specified string. The second element contains the specified string. The third element contains the part after the string. \n",
      "\n",
      "rsplit ==>  The rsplit() method splits a string into a list, starting from the right. If no \"max\" is specified, this method will return the same as the split() method. \n",
      "\n",
      "rstrip ==>  The rstrip() method removes any trailing characters (characters at the end a string), space is the default trailing character to remove. \n",
      "\n",
      "split ==>  The split() method splits a string into a list. You can specify the separator, default separator is any whitespace. \n",
      "\n",
      "splitlines ==>  The splitlines() method splits a string into a list. The splitting is done at line breaks. \n",
      "\n",
      "startswith ==>  The startswith() method returns True if the string starts with the specified value, otherwise False. \n",

      "\n",
      "title ==>  The title() method returns a string where the first character in every word is upper case. Like a header, or a title. If the word contains a number or a symbol, the first letter after that will be converted to upper case. \n",
      "\n",
      "translate ==>  The translate() method returns a string where some specified characters are replaced with the character described in a dictionary, or in a mapping table. Use the maketrans() method to create a mapping table. If a character is not specified in the dictionary/table, the character will not be replaced. If you use a dictionary, you must use ascii codes instead of characters. \n",
      "\n",
      "upper ==>  The upper() method returns a string where all characters are in upper case. \n",
      "\n",
      "zfill ==>  The zfill() method adds zeros (0) at the beginning of the string, until it reaches the specified length. If the value of the len parameter is less than the length of the string, no filling is done. \n",
