    "1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a string. The program should then print the following:\n",
    "    (a) The total number of characters in the string\n",
    "    (b) The string repeated 10 times\n",
    "    (c) The first character of the string (remember that string indices start at 0) (d) The first three\n",
    "    characters of the string\n",
    "    (e) The last three characters of the string\n",
    "    (f) The string backwards\n",
    "    (g) The seventh character of the string if the string is long enough and a message otherwise\n",
    "    (h) The string with its first and last characters removed\n",
    "    (i) The string in all caps\n",
    "    (j) The string with every a replaced with an e\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A simple way to estimate the number of words in a string is to count the number of spaces in the\n",
    "    string. Write a program that asks the user for a string and returns an estimate of how many words\n",
    "    are in the string.\n",
    "    Tip: You need to count the number of words using spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word and prints out whether that word contains any\n",
    "    vowels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Improvise above code by providing unique vowels\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a string. The program should create a new string\n",
    "    called new_string from the user’s string such that the second character is changed to an asterisk and\n",
    "    three exclamation points are attached to the end of the string. Finally, print new_string.\n",
    "    Typical output is shown below:\n",
    "    Enter your string: Qbert\n",
    "    Output: Q*ert!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word and determines whether the word is a\n",
    "    palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backwards as forwards\n",
    "\n",
    "7. At a certain school, student email addresses end with @student.college.edu, while professor\n",
    "    email addresses end with @prof.college.edu. Write a program that first asks the user how many\n",
    "    email addresses they will be entering, and then has the user enter those addresses. After all the\n",
    "    email addresses are entered, the program should print out a message indicating either that all the\n",
    "    addresses are student addresses or that there were some professor addresses entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a string, then prints out each letter of the string\n",
    "    doubled and on a separate line. For instance,\n",
    "    if the user entered HEY,\n",
    "    the output would be\n",
    "    HH\n",
    "    EE\n",
    "    YY\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word that contains the letter a. The program should\n",
    "    then print the following two lines: On the first line should be the part of the string up to and\n",
    "    including the the first a, and on the second line should be the rest of the string.\n",
    "    Sample output is shown below:\n",
    "    Enter a word: buffalo\n",
    "    buffa\n",
    "    lo\n",
    "10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word and then capitalizes every other letter of that\n",
    "    word.\n",
    "    So if the user enters rhinoceros,\n",
    "    the program should print rHiNoCeRoS.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Write a program that asks the user to enter two strings of the same length. The program should\n",
    "    then check to see if the strings are of the same length. If they are not, the program should print an\n",
    "    appropriate message and exit. If they are of the same length, the program should alternate the\n",
    "    characters of the two strings. For example,\n",
    "    if the user enters abcde and ABCDE\n",
    "    the program should print out AaBbCcDdEe.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Write a program that asks the user to enter their name in lowercase and then capitalizes the first\n",
    "    letter of each word of their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. The goal of this exercise is to see if you can mimic the behavior of the in operator and the count\n",
    "    and index methods using only variables, for loops, and if statements.\n",
    "    (a) Without using the in operator, write a program that asks the user for a string and a letter\n",
    "    and prints out whether or not the letter appears in the string.\n",
    "    (b) Without using the count method, write a program that asks the user for a string and a\n",
    "    letter and counts how many occurrences there are of the letter in the string.\n",
    "    (c) Without using the index method, write a program that asks the user for a string and a\n",
    "    letter and prints out the index of the first occurrence of the letter in the string. If the letter is\n",
    "    not in the string, the program should say so.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Finding a substring within a string\n",
    "    For example, if we were presented a series of lines formatted as follows:\n",
    "    From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008\n",
    "    and we wanted to pull out only the second half of the address (i.e., uct.ac.za)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Write a Python program to add &#39;ing&#39; at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the\n",
    "    given string already ends with &#39;ing&#39; then add &#39;ly&#39; instead.\n",
    "    If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.\n",
    "    Go to the editor\n",
    "    Sample String : &#39;abc&#39;\n",
    "    Expected Result : &#39;abcing&#39;\n",
    "    Sample String : &#39;string&#39;\n",
    "    Expected Result : &#39;stringly&#39;\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Take the following Python code that stores a string:‘\n",
    "    string = &#39;X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475&#39;\n",
    "    Extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert\n",
    "    the extracted string into a floating point number."
